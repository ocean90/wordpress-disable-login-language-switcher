Removes the language dropdown from the login screen.

## Description ##

This plugin helps you to declutter your WordPress login screen by removing the language switcher which has been [introduced in WordPress 5.9](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/12/20/introducing-new-language-switcher-on-the-login-screen-in-wp-5-9/). This is mostly useful when you only have one additional language installed and don't intend to change back to English for example.
